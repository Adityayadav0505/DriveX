- **Cache**: Redis

## 📌 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 17+
- Maven or Gradle
- AWS Account with S3 Bucket
- MySQL/PostgreSQL Database
- Redis Server (running locally or on cloud)

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Adityayadav0505/DriveX.git
cd DriveX
```

### 3️⃣ Configure the Application
Create a `secrets.properties` file to store sensitive credentials:

```properties
aws.accessKey=your-access-key
aws.secretKey=your-secret-key
aws.s3.bucketName=your-bucket-name
jwt.username=your-jwt-secret
jwt.password=your-jwt-secret
redis.host=localhost  # Redis Host
redis.port=6379       # Redis Port
```

Add path to `application.properties` file

```path
spring.config.import=secrets.properties
```

Add `secrets.properties` to `.gitignore` to keep it out of Git.

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

Authenticate and Obtain JWT Token

To use the API, first authenticate by sending a POST request:

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/authenticate" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"your-username", "password":"your-password"}'
```

The response will include a JWT token, which you need to include in subsequent API requests.

Upload a File Using cURL
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/upload" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -F "file=@/path/to/your/file"
```

Download a File Using cURL
```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/download/{fileId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

#### Using Maven:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
#### Using Gradle:
```sh
gradle bootRun
```
